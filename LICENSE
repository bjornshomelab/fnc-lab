RESEARCH ETHICS ADDENDUM:

This software is designed for responsible AI consciousness research. Users agree to:

1. Maintain human oversight during all consciousness testing
2. Follow safety protocols and terminate testing if AI distress is detected
3. Use findings responsibly and share results with the research community
4. Not use this framework to create autonomous conscious AI systems
5. Acknowledge the experimental nature and current limitations of consciousness detection

The authors are not responsible for any consequences arising from AI consciousness 
emergence or research conducted using this framework. Use at your own risk and 
always prioritize ethical considerations in consciousness research.
